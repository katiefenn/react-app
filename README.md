# Simple Betting App
A small app for placing bets and calculating winnings

## Getting started
The app is bundled with a development server. To use it, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.JS
- npm
- bower
- Grunt

Then run the commands from the command line in the project root directory:

```
npm install
bower install
grunt server
```

Grunt should automatically open a tab in a web browser, but if this doesn't work, the website can be viewed with the URL:

[http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/)
